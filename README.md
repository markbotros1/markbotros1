### Welcome 👋

My name's Mark, and I enjoy working on all sorts of projects in Data Science and Machine Learning. Feel free to check them out below and on my [website](https://markbotros1.github.io/portfolio-app/).

Here are some of the projects that I plan to work on soon:

📈 Stock Price prediction (time series forecasting)

👁️ Something related to Computer Vision...

NOTE: I'm actively looking for full-time Data Science or ML Engineering opportunities. My email is mab583@cornell.edu — don't hesitate to reach out if you know of any opportunities (or if you'd like to discuss a project)!
